# Commerce
Commerce is an easy-to-use application that allows users to create and participate in auctions.

- Create listings.
- Close your listings to choose the winner, who is the user who bid last.
- Bid on listings created by other users.
- Save listings to your watchlist.
- Leave comments under listings.
- Monitor active listings.
- Monitor listings that you have created, bid on, or won.
- Monitor listings in specific categories.
